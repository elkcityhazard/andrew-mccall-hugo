					<p>Some people are fighting against the idea that having a social media presence nowadays is an essential way of doing business. We happen to know several companies who have killed off their Twitter and Facebook accounts, only to confirm they lost customers as a result because it was difficult for them to find these businesses online. If you&rsquo;re thinking about pulling the plug on social networking in 2022, we&rsquo;d advise you examine your business goals carefully first and decide whether or not removing your social media presence can help you achieve them.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-overview-of-the-power-of-social-media-marketing">A Brief Overview of the Power of Social Media Marketing</h2>
<p>Social media marketing is often the first thing that comes to mind when people think of marketing on the Internet. However, many companies still find it challenging to create a successful social media marketing campaign. A big reason for that is that social media management for small business is a lot more complicated than it seems. Social media management for small business is not just about broadcasting your message and hoping it will be seen. Successful campaigns are based on strategy and planning. It’s about understanding the different social media channels, knowing your target audience, and setting goals for your campaign.  <a href="/services/traverse-city-web-design/" title="Web Designer In Traverse City">Having consistent branding for your business</a> is important.  The messaging and design should be the same across all of your channels.</p>
<h2 id="why-social-media-is-important-for-everyone">Why Social Media Is Important for Everyone</h2>
<p>Social Media is a huge part of our lives. The platforms that we use on a daily basis: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat all offer different benefits to those who use them. A survey conducted by Pew Research Center found that “82% of social media users said the sites helped them personally connect with friends and family and 76% said the sites had helped with their professional lives.”</p>
<p>A major benefit offered by social media is the ability for companies to advertise their products without paying outrageous amounts of money. With these sites, advertisers can post videos or articles with links to products which can be seen by millions of people across the globe in a matter of seconds. This type of advertising has been referred to as &ldquo;free marketing.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="5-best-practices-for-effective-social-media-marketing">5 Best Practices for Effective Social Media Marketing</h2>
