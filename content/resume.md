## Objective

Fullstack web developer with 6 years of experience, seeking to leverage my expertise in modern web technologies to contribute to your organization's mission. Proficient in Golang, Javascript, PHP, Mysql, Postgresql, MongoDB, NodeJS, ExpressJS, HapiJS, Semantic HTML, Web Component API, modern CSS, and more. 
## History
***
I am a software developer currently living in Traverse City, Michigan. I am married to [Elizabeth Bohnhorst](http://elizabethbohnhorst.com "Elizabeth Bohnhorst - Poet & Creative Writer") and pet parent to Allyson (Ally). I started making websites in the late 90s. My first website was hosted on Geocities and was all about my favorite band at the time - Bon Jovi. **Note:** It was terrible.

I worked for many years in the meat and seafood sector and was employed by Whole Foods Market, Belcampo Meat Company, and Lucky's Market. It was in this career path that I developed analytics skills curating perishable stock and, most importantly, soft skills managing a variety of teams.

In 2018, I found myself where the sidewalks end in the meat and seafood industry. I had explored the aspects of the industry that were exciting to me, and I decided that I had achieved all of my goals. At that point, I was working with Belcampo Meat and had quite a bit of experience managing Amazon Fresh inventory, in-house inventory for our brick and mortar, and our own Shopify inventory for our website.

During this time, I was living in Los Angeles, California. I decided to sell my car since I was able to conveniently take public transit to anywhere of interest. Because I was _no longer stuck in traffic_, I had a bit of extra time on my hands which reinvigorated my interest in web development and software creation in general.

I spent some time familiarizing myself with modern web development practices. This led to the creation of __Protoweb Digital Solutions__, my own personal web development agency.

Freelancing is a great way to gain some real-world experience. During this period, I started by finding clients and creating websites with __semantic HTML__, __vanilla CSS__, __SCSS/SASS__, __Javascript__, __PHP__, and __Wordpress__. As I moved on to more bespoke problems, I started to learn __NodeJS__, __Express JS__, __Hapi JS__, __MongoDB__, __SQL__, & __Postgres__, and __Postman__, __Docker__, __git__, and the Javascript Library __React__.

In addition to freelancing, I also worked for [Addiction Campuses](https://www.rehabcenter.net "Rehab Center - Formerly Addiction Campuses") From 2016 - 2018 as a __backlinker__. This experience taught me that there is a ton of low-quality content, and poor-quality sites on the internet. If we invest in both the quality of our content, and the presentation of our content, we are more likely to succeed as web developers. What I noticed during this period is that building a website is more than just coding it. There is a lot of effort that needs to go into the design system, accessibility, user experience, content presentation, testing, and analysis.

Addiction Campuses was acquired by a special interest hedge fund group in 2018. I was laid off, and went to work as an IT Associate for a local Community Food Co-op called [Oryana Food Coop](https://www.oryanafoodcoop.com "Oryana Food Co-op Traverse City, Michigan"). Oryana had purchased another local supermarket in a bankruptcy, and I was tasked with assisting in the integration of the newly acquired supermarket with the existing coop.

In addition to maintaining computers and printers, I also maintained POS software, assisted in the upgrade to a fiber connection, and replaced hardware switches. Additionally, I created a cybersecurity annual training, upgraded our systems to require 2FA, and created extensive documentation for feature IT associates.

In 2022, after weathering the pandemic, most of the projects I was interested in at the co-op were complete. I decided to leave for a web development position at a local broadcasting company, [910 Media Group](https://9and10news.com "9 and 10 News"). I was brought on to migrate 15 years of legacy Wordpress data to a new <abbr title="Platform As A Service">PAAS</abbr> named [ARCXP](https://www.arcxp.com "Arc XP - A Washington Post Product").

This involved building a migration adapter that would adapt several eras of Wordpress data from different vendor systems to [Arc Native Specification](https://github.com/washingtonpost/ans-schema "Arc Native Specification") which is a JSON-like content specification for multiple types of content. The adapter crawled the legacy Wordpress site, went out and fetched the data from their microservices, and created an ANS object that would define the content piece and upload it to ARCXP.

Additionally, I have built several microservices to integrate with ARCXP such as a user-generated content photo submission utility, and an ARCXP utility which handles busy work like renaming sections, recirculating sections, pruning photo galleries, and a custom form submission microservice for our newsletter.

I also build React components for the site utilizing __Agile__ principles and __Test Driven Development__, and implemented Google Tag Manager and Adsense on the website.

In addition to working on [9and10news.com](https://9and10news.com "9and10news.com"), I also have worked on several legacy projects which were inherited in an acquisition. This includes: [mynorth.com](https://mynorth.com "mynorth.com"), A recovery coach application for Addiction Treatment Services, A Wordpress website for [Sharecare Leelanau](https://sharecareleelanau.org "Sharecare Wordpress Website"), A user voting Wordpress site for [Voices For Community Health](https://voicesforcommunityhealth.org "Voices For Community Mental Health By Munson Healthcare"), [Shanty Creek](https://shantycreek.com "Shanty Creek Resort"), and [Traverse Trails](https://traversetrails.org "TART Trail Traverse City").

Finally, I also maintain the front-end JavaScript for the webview of our mobile news app. This involves writing CSS and JavaScript for a custom webview that consumes our ARCXP content. This also involves maintaining relationships between vendors to ensure consistent operations for our website and news app.

I am interested in __Lua__ and __Neovim__.  I tend to not accept ___automagic___ solutions, and extending a terminal based text editor with lua is a step to better understand how modern text editors like __VSCode__ work.  

This also allows me to easily navigate a VPS and have a familiar editing environment on any server utilizing __Vim__, __Tmux__, and built in linux tools like __Find__, and __Grep__.

Looking forward, I aim to integrate the skills from my past employment with skills I have been learning on the side. Frontend has been meaningful work, but my current focus and interest is on backend and full-stack. My current language of choice is __Go__. __Golang__ ticks several boxes for me: simplicity, performance, first-class support for concurrency, and excellent out-of-the-box tooling for testing and benchmarking.

I am looking for a more intermediate position involving database design, data modeling, backend architecture, and a continuation of building on my current modern web technology knowledge. Ideally, this role would be within a team environment that can push me beyond my current comfort zone to unlock the next level of my web development journey.
