Hi, my name is Andrew M McCall and thank you for visiting my website. My website journey began in 1998 when I created my first Bon Jovi fan website (it was terrible)!

I primarily work with Go and Javascript these days.  Sometimes I dive into Wordpress as well when needed.  

My favorite part of developing web applications is helping to solve real world business problems.  

I have worked with Javascript, Go, PHP, Wordpress, Git, SQL, Postgresql, Mongodb, and many other technologies.  

I currently live in Traverse City, Michigan.  I am married to [Elizabeth Bohnhorst](https://elizabethbohnhorst.com "Elizabeth Bohnhorst - Poet and Writer") and pet father to Ally.  

In my free time I enjoy coffee, bike riding, freshwater aquariums, writing songs, and spending time with my wife and dog.

This site mainly serves as a teaching / learning resource.  I love chatting with other developers, especially new developers making a career transition.  

I would like to connect with you! [Book A Free Web Dev Coffee Chat Session With Me](https://book.andrew-mccall.com/ "Andrew McCall - Web Dev Coffee Chat Signup Form").
