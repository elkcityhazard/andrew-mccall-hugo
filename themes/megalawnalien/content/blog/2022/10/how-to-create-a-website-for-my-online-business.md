## Why Do You Need A Business Website?

A business website is one of the most important tools you can have for promoting your company online. It is a cost-effective way to reach out to potential customers and clients, and it can help you build a strong online presence.

It can be used to showcase your products and services, provide information about your company, and even sell products and services online. If you are not sure where to start, there are many website builders and platforms that can help you build a professional website quickly and easily as well as a few DIY options.

In this article, we will explore some of the the elements needed and ways you can create a website for your online business.  

## Start With A Website Builder For Your Small Business Website

A website builder is a tool that allows you to create a website without having to code or design it yourself. There are many advantages to using a website builder, especially if you are a small business owner.


One of the biggest advantages is that it is much easier to use than traditional methods. You don’t need any coding or design skills – all you need to do is select a template and start adding your content.

Another big advantage is that most website builders include website design. This means that you don’t have to worry about hiring a separate designer or learning how to code.


Finally, most website builders are very affordable – and some are even free. If you’re looking for an easy, affordable, and professional way to create a small business website, then a website builder is the perfect solution.

Website builders are an area where you get what you pay for.  Services like webpack are feature-rich while free solutions are often very limited.  For example. no custom coding, no code-embedding features which you may need later down to get more out of your templated website.  


Although there are many free website builder solutions for small business, I prefer to recommend services such as Squarespace or Shopify which are paid solutions. Their costs are generally small to get started and many small businesses find that paying a bit extra goes a long way in terms of features you get for your business website.

[Squarespace](https://squarespace.com)


Squarespace is a website builder and hosting platform that allows users to create and customize professional-looking websites with no programming or design experience required. With Squarespace, users can create blogs, e-commerce stores, and portfolio sites with ease. The platform also includes features like analytics, SEO tools, and 24/7 customer support.
  
[Shopify](https:?/www.shopify.com)

Shopify is a great platform for building a business website for a few key reasons. First, it is very user-friendly and easy to use, even for those with no prior experience in website design or development. Second, Shopify provides a wide range of templates and themes that can be used to create a professional-looking website without the need to hire a separate web designer. Finally, Shopify offers a number of features and tools that can help streamline the process of running an online business, from managing inventory and orders to processing payments and shipping products. In sum, Shopify is an excellent choice for those looking to build a comprehensive and successful business website.

[Webflow](https://webflow.com/)

Low code website building is a method of creating websites using visual drag-and-drop tools, rather than traditional coding languages. This approach makes website creation more accessible to non-programmers, and can speed up the development process.

Webflow is one of the leading low code website solutions, with an easy-to-use interface and a wide range of features. It's used by major brands such as Nike, Samsung, and Sony, and has been voted the best low code platform by [G2 Crowd](https://www.g2.com/products/webflow/reviews).


[Elementor](https://elementor.com/)

There are many reasons why Elementor is a popular choice for WordPress-based website builders. One reason is that it is very user-friendly and easy to use, even for beginners. It also has a wide range of features and plugins that can be used to create almost any type of website. Elementor also has a very active community of users and developers who are always creating new plugins and add-ons to help make website building even easier.

[DIVI](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/)

Divi by Elegant Themes is a popular Wordpress site builder because it’s flexible, easy to use and it comes with a lot of features.

One of the best things about Divi is that it’s constantly being updated with new features, which makes it one of the most popular site builders on the market.

However, one of the downsides of Divi is that it can be quite expensive. If you’re looking for a more affordable alternative to Divi, then you should check out Beaver Builder.

[Beaver Builder](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/) is a WordPress site builder that’s just as powerful as Divi but at a fraction of the price. It comes with all the same features as Divi, plus some extra ones that make it even easier to use.

Plus, Beaver Builder has a very active community behind it so you can always find help if you need it.

[WP Bakery](https://wpbakery.com/) 

The WPBakery Page Builder WordPress plugin gives you complete control over your website. With its intuitive drag-and-drop builder, you can create any layout you can imagine without needing any programming knowledge.

## Choose Your Domain Name Carefully For Your Business Website

Your domain name is your small business's home on the internet. It's how your customers find you online and it's a key part of your branding. So choosing the right domain name for your small business website is essential. 

Here are a few tips to help you choose a great domain name for your small business:

1.  Keep it short and sweet. A short domain name is easier for your customers to remember.
2.  Make it relevant to your business. A domain name that's relevant to your business will help you build brand recognition.
3.  Avoid using hyphens. Hyphens can make it harder for people to find your website [Funny because this website uses hyphens].
4.  Get creative. A creative domain name can help you stand out from the competition.
5.  Use a .com extension. A .com domain is the most recognizable and most trusted and much better than many free domain names.
6.  Think of how people search for your product or business. Do they search for "hair salon in Chicago?" Sometimes it is a good strategy to build keyword relevancy right into the domain name. For example, "hairsalonchicago.com."

## Free Website Templates Are A Great Place To Start

When you are first starting your small business, you may not have the time or money to invest in a custom website design. However, this does not mean that your website has to look lackluster. There are many great website templates available that can give your website a professional look without breaking the bank.

In addition to being cost-effective, website templates are also easy to use. Even if you have no experience with web design, you should be able to find a template that meets your needs and fairly easily edit it to create a great looking website for your business.

If you are technical, or have someone on your team who is tech savvy, a template (such as an html template or wordpress template) can be an excellent option. Templates are generally more flexible than website builders since you can directly edit the template files as needed.

So if you are starting a small business and need to get a website up and running quickly and cheaply, consider using a website template and hiring a value-oriented web develop. It could be just what you need to get your business off the ground.

A note on purchasing website templates: When you purchase a website template, you must agree to the terms of use set forth by the template creator. These terms of use vary depending on the template, but usually include restrictions on how you can modify and distribute the template. Some creators also require that you give them credit for the design, while others allow you to use the template for free as long as you don't redistribute it. Be sure to read the terms of use before purchasing or using a website template.
