<li><strong>Blockchain Architecture</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Blockchain technology is the most revolutionary technology in the IT market today, and it will continue to grow exponentially. Blockchain technology is defined as a decentralized, distributed database built on a network of computers, with the data stored in a secure, transparent, and permanent manner. Blockchain technology has the power to change the way the internet works. Blockchain technology is also transforming the way websites are built.
