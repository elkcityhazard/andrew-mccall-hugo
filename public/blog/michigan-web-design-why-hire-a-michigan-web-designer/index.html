					<p>A web design company is an important aspect of your business that can help you achieve success in this digital age. They bring together the right team of professionals to create the look, feel and user-friendliness of your online presence, which in turn affects how well your business does overall. Michigan Web Design by Andrew McCall is a leading local marketing agency located in Traverse City, Michigan.</p>
<h3 id="michigan-web-design-company">Michigan Web Design Company</h3>
<p>I am a Michigan based web designer and developer located in Traverse City, Michigan. I have been working as a freelance web designer and developer for over 4 years. I have been working with small businesses in Michigan&rsquo;s northern lower peninsula, as well as larger companies in the greater Detroit area. I have a strong skill set in Web Development, Creative Design, Search Engine Optimization, and Social Media Marketing.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-us-unique">What Makes Us Unique?</h3>
<p>When you are starting a new business, it&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in the excitement of the process. There are so many things you want to do! So many ideas that will change your industry forever! But while you&rsquo;re focused on making your product better, more efficient, or prettier than everyone else&rsquo;s, remember that there is one thing that no company can ever perfect: its own brand. Branding is one of the most important aspects of any business. It is what separates you from your competitors, and it is what makes people remember you. Your brand will be with you for years to come, so it&rsquo;s important that you focus on what message and values your brand delivers.</p>
<p>I can scale a team of creative and technical people who work with brands, small and medium-sized businesses and product startups to help them grow their brand and convey their values to their customers.</p>
<p>I am not just a design and development freelancer. I also serve as an inbound marketing agency, using content marketing to develop thought leadership in your industry or niche for you.</p>
