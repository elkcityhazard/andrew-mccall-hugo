  <h1>20 Traverse City Web Design Companies | A Complete Website Design List</h1>
  
  
  <time datetime="2022-07-11T00:00:00&#43;00:00">July 11, 2022</time>

  <p>There are many great options for web design and graphic design in Northern Michigan. The area is home to a number of talented designers who can create stunning websites and graphics that will help your business stand out from the competition. Whether you&rsquo;re looking for a simple website or something more complex, you&rsquo;re sure to find a designer in Northern Michigan who can meet your needs.</p>
<p>We break down 20 web design agencies in Northern Michigan to help you make the best decision possible for your next web design project.</p>
<h2 id="1-traverse-city-web-design">1. Traverse City Web Design</h2>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Traverse City Web Design practices &ldquo;Goal Based Web Design.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>URL</strong>: <a href="https://traversecitywebdesign.com/">Traverse City Web Design</a><br>
<strong>Address</strong>: 136 East 17th Street Traverse City, Michigan, 49684
<strong>Type</strong>: Agency<br>
<strong>Services</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web Design</li>
<li>Website Management &amp; Hosting</li>
<li>Website Updates, Improvements, and Repairs</li>
<li>Website Hosting, Management, and Configuration</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons To Choose</strong>:  If you are familiar with Wordpress, or if you already have a Wordpress website, Traverse City Web Design will most likely be able to serve you.  Their design fees are not stated on their website, but they do provide hosting feels.  Their plans range from $35/month to $125/month.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons To Avoid</strong>:  There is a plethora of managed Wordpress hosting options out there for as little as $9.99/month.   Some of the most popular managed Wordpress hosting providers are WP Engine, Flywheel, and Kinsta. If you are a small business, and your marketing needs are simple, I would consider using these options which will offer many of the same features seen here for hosting but for less since you will be managing some elements of the hosting yourself.</p>
<h2 id="2-traverse-web">2. Traverse Web</h2>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: &ldquo;Simple Web Solutions For Immediate Results&rdquo; <br>
<strong>URL</strong>: <a href="https://traverseweb.com/">Traverse Web</a><br>
<strong>Address</strong>: 1605 Shannie Lane, Traverse City MI 49696<br>
<strong>Type</strong>: Agency<br>
<strong>Services</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web Design</li>
<li>Ecommerce</li>
<li>Domains and Hosting</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons To Choose</strong>:  Traverse Web offer a variety of different website design packages.  Traverse Web offers a singular hosting plan which is simple.  Traverse Web has several website design options to choose from.  Their barebone package is a little expensive for what you get.  That being said, their plans are scaleable.  Wordpress is an option as well as ecommerce.   They also offer an online support ticketing portal as well as traditional phone support.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons To Avoid</strong>: Base website package has some nice features but is limited in the amount of pages you get for the cost.  The next plan up solves this issue by offering Wordpress as an option.  There are, however, agencies out there that offer wordpress plans for the same cost as the base package or less.</p>
<h2 id="3-byte-productions">3. Byte Productions</h2>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: &ldquo;Building A Better Web&rdquo;<br>
<strong>URL</strong>: <a href="https://www.byte-productions.com/">Byte Productions</a><br>
<strong>Address</strong>: 226 E. Sixteenth St. Suite C Traverse City, MI  49684<br>
<strong>Type</strong>: Agency<br>
<strong>Services</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web Design</li>
<li>Custom Programming</li>
<li>Case Studies</li>
<li>Website Hosting</li>
<li>E-Commerce</li>
<li>Search Engine Optimization</li>
<li>Event Registration</li>
<li>Progressive Web Apps</li>
<li>Medical Websites</li>
<li>Real Estate Websites</li>
<li>Punchout</li>
<li>Web To Print</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons To Choose</strong>: They don&rsquo;t use Wordpress.  Many Northern Michigan website design agencies use Wordpress for convenience of development and end-user experience.  Byte Productions does not work with Wordpress.   Wordpress is the only platform for content management systems.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons To Avoid</strong>:  They don&rsquo;t use Wordpress.  The question I would ask is what do they use?  Wordpress may not be a great experience for all businesses.  But an even worse experience is trying to move your website from a proprietary content management system to a new host.  Often times, business owners will face a necessary growing pain.  Running your business means having a website that is scalable and user-friendly.</p>
<p>Professional websites should be very portable.  In the event your business decides to end it&rsquo;s current hosting agreement, a proprietary hosting solution can  be extremely difficult to port to a new web hosting service.  Often times, sites have to be redeveloped from scratch, and adapters have to be written to convert the old database to a new database.  This means additional costs for your business.</p>
<h2 id="4-proweb-marketing--hosting-solutions">4. ProWeb Marketing | Hosting Solutions</h2>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: &ldquo;The Solution For Your Online Presence&rdquo;<br>
<strong>URL</strong>: <a href="https://prowebmarketing.com/">ProWeb Marketing</a><br>
<strong>Address</strong>: 830 E. Front Street #324 Traverse City, MI 49686<br>
<strong>Type</strong>: Agency<br>
<strong>Services</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Website Design and Development</li>
<li>Web Programming</li>
<li>Website Hosting</li>
<li>Content Development</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons To Choose</strong>: They have a client center on their website.  Again, if you are married to Wordpress they are another competitor in the field.   They offer 3 new website packages.  The lowest tier does not include search engine optimization but they do offer it.  Mobile Responsive (though all web design firms should offer this at this point).  They also offer form integration and Ecommerce services.  This is great if you have customers who can take advantage of an ecommerce service.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons To Avoid</strong>: If you don&rsquo;t like Wordpress ProWeb Marketing may not be the best choice.  If you are looking for a very basic website that is SEO optimized, there smallest tier is limited.  Also, their smallest tier does not offer a custom quote form at $1000.  Websites that are not SEO optimized and have no custom quote form are usually limited in visibility to searchers.  Even if they find your site, how will they easily contact you?</p>
<h2 id="5-legendary-lion">5. Legendary Lion</h2>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: &ldquo;WE BUILD ONLINE BUSINESSES A DIGITAL CREATIVE AGENCY FOR SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEURS&rdquo;<br>
<strong>URL</strong>: <a href="https://www.legendarylion.com/">Legendary Lions</a><br>
<strong>Address</strong>: 444 Cass St Suite A, Traverse City, MI 49684<br>
<strong>Type</strong>: Agency<br>
<strong>Services</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Planning Workshop</li>
<li>Brand Design &amp; Identity Systems</li>
<li>Websites</li>
<li>Apps</li>
<li>Web Marketing</li>
<li>Consultation</li>
<li>Support Plus</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons To Choose</strong>: If you are looking for a smaller digital creative team that can do many tasks, Legendary Lion may be a good fit.  They appear to use Wordpress as their content management system of choice.  They highlight Brand Design as one of their main services.  They appear to have a heavy focus on the mental health industry.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons To Avoid</strong>: Appear to focus on the mental health industry.   No dedicated graphic designer.  web and graphic design is handled by the web development team.  The only mention of search engine optimization on their website is a blog post from 2012.</p>
<h2 id="6-flight-path-creative-digital-marketing">6. Flight Path Creative Digital Marketing</h2>

<p><strong>Reasons To Choose</strong>: If you don&rsquo;t want to work with Wordpress.  Squarespace has tons of built in conversion features.  Customization is becoming easier.</p>

Many businesses use Squarespace and it is functional, however.  Easy-to-use would be a cornerstone of Squarespace.  That being said, you can easily drag and drop your own Squarespace website, especially if your website falls into the category of business cards.  <strong>Not based in Traverse City, Michigan.</strong></p>
