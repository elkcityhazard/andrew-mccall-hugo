					<p>Installing <a href="https://gohugo.io" title="Hugo - The World's Fastest Website Generator">Hugo</a> on Windows is easy with <a href="https://community.chocolatey.org/" title="Windows 10 Software Package Manager">chocolately package manager</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For those who are not familiar, Hugo is a static website generator that can help you manage blazing fast static websites with minimal effort.</p>
<p>If you are on Windows, installing Hugo is easy using Chocolately Package Manager.  Here are the steps we take.</p>
<h2 id="directions-to-install-hugo-on-windows-10-with-chocolately-package-manager">Directions To Install Hugo on Windows 10 With Chocolately Package Manager</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Navigate to <a href="https://community.chocolatey.org/" title="Windows 10 Software Package Manager">chocolately package manager</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the <a href="https://chocolatey.org/install" title="install chocolately package manager">&ldquo;install&rdquo;</a> link which is located at the top right hand corner next to the light/dark toggle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select <code>individual</code> install method</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open up an elevated administrator instance of Windows Powershell.  To accomplish this, the fastest way is to press the Windows key which will open up the start menu.  Start typing <code>Powershell</code>.  Next, you will need to right-click on Windows Powershell and select <code>Run As Administrator</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next we will need to check the <code>Execution Policy</code>.  This is as simple as copying and pasting the following line into the elevated Powershell: <code>Get-ExecutionPolicy</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The related section from the official installation documentation says the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run <code>Get-ExecutionPolicy</code>. If it returns <code>Restricted</code>, then run <code>Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned</code> or <code>Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the Execution Policy is set all we need to do now is actually install chocolatey:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(&lsquo;<a href="https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'">https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'</a>))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you paste the text into Powershell, press <code>Enter</code> and wait a few moments for it to install.  Once the script has executed all that is left is to type <code>choco</code> to verify that Chocolately is now installed.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>Once that is completed, we can get on with installing Hugo.  To  do that simply type <code>choco install hugo -a</code>.  This will automatically download the latest release of Hugo and the flag <code>-a</code> says to Chocolately to go ahead and install the package (you can manually confirm this by ommiting the -a flag).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the package has installed, simply type <code>hugo version</code> to verify the installation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
