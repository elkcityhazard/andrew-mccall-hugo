					<p>The tips in this article are meant to help you promote your small business. Small businesses have a lot of advantages over large enterprises, but they also have some disadvantages. One disadvantage is the lack of resources and money that larger businesses have. Without money, it can be difficult for a small business to get the same kind of exposure as a large corporation. What follows are 12 tips on how to promote your small business so that you can do just as well if not better than the big guys!</p>
<h2 id="how-to-grow-your-small-business-locally">How To Grow Your Small Business Locally?</h2>
<p>Have you been wondering: how to promote a small business and not sure where to start? If you want to be successful in business, it’s essential to know how to grow your business locally. There are many things you can do to grow your small business, but the first step is to get a good understanding of the local market and competition.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2022/small-business-infographic.jpg" alt="Small business infographic" title="Score.org"></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.score.org/resource/infographic-how-do-americans-support-small-businesses" title="Score.org">score.org</a></p>
<h2 id="determine-the-scope-of-your-products--services">Determine The Scope Of Your Products &amp; Services</h2>
<p>To start with, you should find out where you want to focus your efforts; regionally or locally. If there’s room for growth in both the region and the community, you may want to consider both.</p>
<p>The regional approach focuses on developing a brand that people can identify anywhere in the area. For example, Starbucks has done a great job of this. You can walk into a Starbucks in New York City and be pretty sure that the coffee will taste the same as it does in San Francisco. Is this a product that is going to be consumed over a large geographical area?</p>
<p>According to The <a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/">Chronicle of Philanthropy</a>, 26% of young adults prefer purchasing local products and services. A local approach will be centered around having an awesome product or service that serves a niche in your local market. Local competition can certainly be difficult, but you’d be surprised how powerful word of mouth marketing can be. Nearly 90 percent of online consumers trust recommendations from friends and family above all other forms of advertising, according to a 2017 study by <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/">eMarketer</a>. That’s five times more than they trust paid advertising, and 10 times more than digital advertising.</p>
<h2 id="google-my-business-profile-can-help-your-business-be-seen-locally">Google My Business Profile Can Help Your Business Be Seen Locally</h2>
<p>Having a <a href="https://www.google.com/business">Google My Business</a> page is a must have for businesses that want to be found online. It can help your business appear in search results, on Google Maps and even in <a href="https://ads.google.com/home/">Google AdWords</a>. With over half of all consumers using their smartphone to find businesses, having a high quality listing on Google My Business is essential for any business owner looking to gain more customers.</p>
<p>Over 1.6 billion searches are performed on Google each month. This means, if you have a Google My Business listing, potential customers are able to see your business information anytime and anywhere they search online. Your customers can also contact you directly through your page, letting you save your customers&rsquo; contact information.</p>
<p>Google My Business (GMB) is a free, easy-to-manage tool that helps you control the information that appears with your business across Google&rsquo;s local search results and services. You can manage your business information on Google Maps and Google search, as well as through ads on millions of sites across the web.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-advertise-my-local-business-through-utilizing-local-directory-listings">How To Advertise My Local Business Through Utilizing Local Directory Listings</h2>
<p>Local directory listings are a digital marketing tool to increase online visibility and attract more potential customers. When you list your business on local directories, you can expect many benefits like increased traffic, new customers, and online visibility. Local directory listings are a useful tool for local businesses to market and advertise. Listing your business on local directories can help you attract new customers and improve your search engine rankings. Local directories also target customers within a specific area.t t</p>
<p>At the bare minimum, you need to at least list your business on the following websites:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/business/" title="Google My Business">Google Business Listings</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.yelp.com" title="Yelp">Yelp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bingplaces.com/" title="Bing Places">Bing Places</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.angi.com/" title="Now Formally Known As Angi">Angi&rsquo;s List</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.freeadstime.org/" title="A Free Advertisement Website">Free Ads Time</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Local directory listings are one of the most effective ways to grow your local business. However, many business owners make a few crucial mistakes when it comes to their directory submissions. They fail to optimize their listings for search engines, leading to low click-through rates.</p>
<p>This is a major problem since more than 90% of customers search online before they visit a brick-and-mortar business. In fact, 88% of consumers use Google and other search engines to find local businesses, and 70% use the information on these local directories to decide where to shop.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-promote-my-small-business--set-up-and-run-a-customer-loyalty-campaign">How Can I Promote My Small Business | Set Up And Run A Customer Loyalty Campaign</h2>
<p>A customer loyalty program (also referred as “loyalty program”, “loyalty scheme” or simply “loyalty system”) is a scheme that enables consumers to accumulate rewards and loyalty points (in the form of cash or goods) for purchasing products and services from a company.</p>
<p>A simple customer loyalty program can do wonders for your business. It has the power to increase customer interactions and encourage repeat purchases, while also facilitating brand awareness. And once you&rsquo;ve set up a loyalty program, it&rsquo;s easy to maintain and grow over time–and it can even lower your costs by reducing unnecessary spending.</p>
<p>Customer loyalty programs are among the most effective customer retention strategies, and every business should consider implementing one. With one that aligns with your business goals, you&rsquo;ll be doing your customers a favor while improving your company&rsquo;s bottom line.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cx/marketing/customer-loyalty/what-is-customer-loyalty/">Oracle</a></p>
<h2 id="what-should-a-customer-loyalty-program-do">What Should A Customer Loyalty Program Do?</h2>
<h3 id="create-a-relationship">Create a relationship</h3>
<p>A customer loyalty program is one of the most effective ways for businesses to nurture relationships with their target audiences by providing them incentives for continued participation within the program.</p>
<h3 id="provide-a-product-or-service-that-exceeds-their-expectations">Provide a product or service that exceeds their expectations</h3>
<p>Creating a loyal customer base is going to be an important part of your business model. In order to achieve this, you must offer something that other businesses do not have and are not willing to offer. One of the best ways you can do this is by creating a customer loyalty program. One of the biggest pitfalls of customer loyalty programs is that they do not offer enough value to the customer. According to recent research from Forrester, 40% of loyalty program members think they do not get enough value from their program or they’re unsure if they should get value. A Forrester survey also found that those who did not participate in loyalty programs were nearly twice as likely to say they would switch brands.</p>
<h3 id="deliver-what-you-promise">Deliver what you promise</h3>
<p>The value of a customer loyalty program is often underestimated by small businesses. A well-planned and executed loyalty program can show an increase in sales, create brand advocates, attract new customers and even improve the bottom line. With so many benefits to reap from designing a loyalty program, it&rsquo;s surprising that there are still many businesses who don&rsquo;t offer one. Delivering what you promise means not over-promising your customers. Also, make sure to deliver your promises consistently.</p>
<h3 id="show-you-care">Show you care</h3>
<p>When it comes to customer service, everyone talks about being kind, friendly and patient with your customers. But there’s a lot more you can do to show how much you care about them. Providing excellent customer service is only half the battle. You also have to be proactive in communicating with your customers so they know what’s going on.</p>
<p>Bundling new products and short communications with your customer loyalty programs can help keep customers up to date and also get them trying new things. It will also show you are about them because you are adding free value into their lives.</p>
<h3 id="give-them-a-reason-to-return">Give them a reason to return</h3>
<p>Customer loyalty programs give your customers a great reason to return to your business, buy more of what they love, and try new products and services as well. Customer loyalty programs consistently deliver greater return for your sales investment, and, in today’s competitive market, customer loyalty is more important than ever.</p>
<h3 id="thank-them">Thank them</h3>
<p>Customer loyalty programs are a seemingly simple way to say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to your customers. A loyalty program is a series of promotional offers designed to encourage repeat purchases and increase brand awareness. They typically offer rewards such as discounted products or free shipping, but they can also be used to collect customer data and send personalized messages based on the frequency of their purchase or other preferences.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-promote-my-small-business--advertise-your-business-on-local-news-and-sites">How Can I Promote My Small Business | Advertise Your Business On Local News and Sites</h2>
<p>According to a study done by the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/">Pew Research Center</a>, 55 percent of Americans get their news from television. The major networks and local affiliates have become the go-to source for information and entertainment alike. For businesses looking to advertise, this can be a great opportunity. But there is more than one way to reach your audience on TV.</p>
<p>The most traditional form of purchasing airtime is through local and national TV ad agencies, which are usually part of giant conglomerates. Businesses that work with these agencies will find themselves working with a salesperson who may or may not have any idea what they’re selling. The salesperson is there to make a deal, not necessarily to help the client succeed.</p>
<p>Advertisers can also work directly with the networks and cable channels, as well as pay-per-click (PPC) platforms like Google AdWords.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-promote-my-small-business--become-a-local-authoritative-expert-for-your-niche">How Can I Promote My Small Business | Become A Local Authoritative Expert For Your Niche</h2>
<p>Being a local expert for your business niche is one of the most important things you can do to grow your business. As an entrepreneur, you know that time is money. And being able to focus on the aspects of your business that bring in the most revenue is imperative to continued growth and success.</p>
<p>The best way to create a local expert persona for your business is to build a following online. But, there’s a right and wrong way to do it. I’m going to share with you how I was able to build a following in my business niche, so that I could serve my customers better and also grow my business.</p>
<p>You can use social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram to build relationships with other local experts in both your industry and other industries. You can do this by engaging them with your content and eventually asking them if they would like to collaborate on an article.</p>
<h2 id="include-your-branding-on-everything-and-everywhere">Include Your Branding On Everything and Everywhere</h2>
<p>A well-branded business can have a multitude of benefits. Your customers are more likely to recognize your brand, which means they&rsquo;re more likely to purchase from you and even recommend your products or services to their friends. In the end, the cost of branding is worth it in terms of additional sales.</p>
<p>However, you need to be careful about how you brand your business. Your logo is the most important part of your branding strategy, and it&rsquo;s essential that you create a logo that people will remember. If you&rsquo;re not sure where to start, I would suggest hiring someone who can help you create a clean, memorable, and attractive logo.</p>
<p>The logo is arguably the most important aspect of a brand. It is the first thing your target audience sees, after all. So the logo you choose needs to be memorable and eye-catching.</p>
<p>Your logo and branding should be on everything from your business cards, your invoices, your hats, shirts, and anything else that is associated with your business.</p>
<h2 id="print-advertising-is-still-effective-to-promote-your-local-business-in-2022">Print Advertising Is Still Effective To Promote Your Local Business In 2022</h2>
<p>Using print ads to promote your local business can be an effective strategy for attracting new customers. Print advertising can also be used to reinforce the brand you have already established via digital marketing, social media marketing and other forms of non-print advertising. Successful print promotions are creative, engaging and most importantly, memorable.</p>
<p>One recent study by the <a href="https://www.journalofadvertisingresearch.com/">Journal of Advertising Research</a> found that 77% of consumers preferred to receive marketing advice from print advertising, compared with 58% who prefer digital, and 50% who prefer social media.</p>
<p>Local newspapers, magazines, and newsletters are all effective ways to advertise your local business and attract new customers. Many of these publications have high local authority and will help transmit trust to your potential customers.</p>
<h2 id="hire-a-local-seo-expert-to-increase-leads-for-your-business">Hire A Local SEO Expert To Increase Leads For Your Business</h2>
<p>Hiring a local search engine optimization (SEO) expert is one of the best ways to increase leads for your business. Local SEO focuses on ensuring that your business shows up in search results when someone searches within a certain geographic region, nearby location or radius around your business. This way, more people who are looking for services like yours will find you and contact you directly.</p>
<p>According to research conducted by the team at <a href="https://moz.com/">MOZ</a>, 72% of consumers look for local businesses online. This means that your online presence matters more than ever. Local SEO has become an increasingly important aspect of digital marketing strategy for many local businesses.</p>
<p>This is the same case with enterprise companies. Enterprise companies are getting more and more involved in social media, as they realize that they can use it as a highly effective marketing tool. The thing is that you need to know how to use social media for your business, which means that you also need to do some research.</p>
<h2 id="host-specialized-events-to-grow-your-audience-and-increase-your-authority-on-a-topic">Host Specialized Events To Grow Your Audience And Increase Your Authority On A Topic</h2>
<p>Hosting local events is one of the best ways to make your business stand out from the crowd. Events are a phenomenal way to generate sales and leads for a company, but they don&rsquo;t happen overnight. Planning an event takes a lot of time and effort. But if you&rsquo;re willing to invest in an event, it can be very beneficial for your business.</p>
<p>Hosting an event is not an easy task and it goes beyond just putting a few ads out there to get people to sign up. Here are some tips on how to host successful events.</p>
<p>The first step in hosting a successful event is by picking the right location. You want to make sure you have enough space for the number of people who will be attending, but also that you’re not paying too much for rent or tables and chairs. Don’t underestimate the costs of renting a space for an event, especially if you are planning on selling products at the event. You’ll need to also make sure you utliize the principles you have learned in this article and promote the event ahead of time.</p>
<p>Events need to be purpose-driven. For example, is this an event to see products? Demonstrate new and upcoming products for the upcoming sales season? Events can be more than just sales events. Creating an event to teach people the skills necessary to succeed in your niche is a great way to provide value to potential customers and direct them to look to you for coaching and paid advice</p>
<h2 id="how-to-advertise-your-small-business-with-direct-mailings">How To Advertise Your Small Business With Direct Mailings</h2>
<p>Direct mailings are an effective way to reach out to current and potential clients, but they can be challenging to execute well.</p>
<p>Though the internet has made it easier for small businesses to reach a wider audience, direct mailings still have their place in advertising.</p>
<p>Direct mail, which once commanded the attention of consumers, still has the highest response rate of any marketing channel. A 2019 survey by <a href="https://www.validity.com/everest/returnpath/">Return Path (now Validity)</a> found that direct mail had the highest response rate, with 28.9 percent of all messages opened, followed by email at 24.9 percent. TV came in third, with 16.0 percent of ads viewed.</p>
<p>The trick is knowing how to get the most bang for your buck when using this form of advertisement. By following a few simple guidelines, you&rsquo;ll be able to make the most of your direct mailing campaign while saving time and money.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-include-in-a-direct-mail-campaign-and-how-to-advertise-a-small-business-locally-with-it">What to include in a direct mail campaign and how to advertise a small business locally with it</h2>
<p>The data for direct mail has proven that it’s a very effective way to get your message out, but that doesn’t mean that anyone can get results. The key is in knowing what you’re doing. Here are some tips to help you achieve success when sending out direct mail campaigns.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the best time of the year to send mailers.</li>
<li>Make sure you are sending to the right person</li>
<li>Try and use data from a source that is vetted for better results</li>
<li>Personalize your direct mailings</li>
<li>Test the results</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="how-can-i-promote-my-small-business-with-google-ads">How Can I Promote My Small Business With Google Ads?</h1>
<p>All small businesses have the same goal when it comes to promoting their business: get more customers. And for many small businesses, Google Ads is one of the most effective ways to reach new prospects and bring in new revenue.</p>
<p>Google has more users searching for local products and services than any other platform. With more than 1 billion searches each day, it’s the only place you can reach these potential customers using Google Ads.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why there are so many businesses using Google Ads to grow their business. Whether you&rsquo;re just starting out or you&rsquo;ve been using Google Ads for a while now, use these tips as your guide.</p>
<h3 id="tip-1-define-your-target-audience">Tip 1: Define your target audience</h3>
<p>In order to create content that will attract your target audience, you need to understand who it is you’re trying to attract. This means your content strategy needs to take into account your audience demographics, interests, and goals.</p>
<p>Look at your sales funnel and understand the different stages of your customer journey. Identify the customer pain points and develop content around them. For example, if your product is meant for young professionals, create content on things like career advancement or how to deal with stress.</p>
<h2 id="tip-2-use-a-call-to-action">Tip 2: Use a call to action</h2>
<p>A call to action is a way to encourage your readers (or listeners) to take specific actions. The most common way to do this is by creating a strong CTA button for your website. You can also create calls to action using videos or other media. For example, the beginning and end of a podcast episode are good places to include CTAs so that you can connect with listeners in different ways.</p>
<h2 id="tip-3-make-sure-you-have-a-landing-page-that-displays-well-on-mobile-devices">Tip 3: Make sure you have a landing page that displays well on mobile devices!</h2>
<p>Having a mobile-friendly website is not just a trend. It&rsquo;s an essential part of your digital marketing strategy. In fact, Google announced that in 2017, it will begin to factor mobile friendliness into its search algorithm – meaning websites that are not mobile-friendly could be penalized by the search engine! The question isn&rsquo;t whether or not you need a mobile site; it&rsquo;s how you can make sure yours looks great on all devices.</p>
<h2 id="tip-4-make-sure-you-are-tracking-your-results">Tip 4: Make sure you are tracking your results!</h2>
<p>If you are an entrepreneur, I am sure that you have heard about Google AdWords. It is a great way to achieve business goals, but it can be difficult to manage if you do not know what you&rsquo;re doing. The first step towards successful PPC advertising is monitoring your campaigns closely and analyzing the data they provide.</p>
<h2 id="tip-5-consider-the-adwords-display-network-for-additional-reach">Tip 5: Consider the AdWords Display Network for additional reach!</h2>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s important to focus on your target audience when creating a campaign, the Display Network can help expand your reach and make it easier for users to find your ads. The Display Network is available in 190+ countries and 97% of all internet users are on the Display Network.</p>
<p>The majority of advertisers get their start with search engine marketing (SEM) by using Google AdWords. Why? SEM is quick and easy to implement, offers immediate results, and you&rsquo;re able to measure how well your ads are performing.</p>
<p>When you create an AdWords campaign, you choose keywords that describe your business and its products or services. Your ad will then appear when someone searches for those keywords on Google.</p>
<p>In Google’s search results, ads appear above organic search results, pushing down other ads and search results. Advertisers bid on keywords, (or types of keywords), that they think their target audience is using to search for the products or services they offer. The highest bidder wins the auction and gets their ad to appear at the top of search results for that keyword.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-grow-your-small-business-on-instagram">How To Grow Your Small Business On Instagram</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://simplified.app/ai/document/backlinko.com">backlinko.com</a>, Instragram has one billion monthly active users and 500 million daily active users. Utilizing Instagram to help grow your business is a no-brainer. If you are still using a personal account, now is the time to explore all the features of switching over to an Instagram business account. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are selling physical, digital, or services, Instagram comes with a limitless income potential. What makes Instagram unique as a marketing tool is that you can engage with your customers on a personal level, target your key personas, and the added ability for customers to social-share your products and services to other people who might benefit from your services.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-instagram-business-account-and-optimize-instagram-account">Set Up Instagram Business Account and Optimize Instagram Account</h2>
<p>Setting up an Instagram business account is as easy as tapping the settings button, navigating to your account, and then selecting switch to business account. Once you have activated your Instagram business account, you will have access to Instagram&rsquo;s insights feature which gives you powerful metrics and insights that will help you grow your business and Instagram engagements.</p>
<p>If you have Instagram business activated on your account you will be able to see age, gender, location. and the most active online times. Additionally, you will also get individual posts insights which is awesome for tracking post engagement - another important metric for measuring success with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Optimize Your Instagram Bio</strong></p>
<p>Starting with the picture, you don&rsquo;t want your business or brand logo to be squished into the portrait circle. If you need to make a custom avatar logo so that it can be easily read than do so. Sometimes it is acceptable to shorten your name to just an acronym to meet this purpose.</p>
<p>Not only should you use an interesting and engaging design (which will increase followers) but also try to use emojis. These are the trendiest form of expression right now and make your bio pop. This is especially true for your bio statement.</p>
<p>When you write your bio statement, it should tell potential followers exactly what you are all about. Whether it&rsquo;s a statement about your business, or what you are going to be posting about, potential leads shouldn&rsquo;t have to guess what type of content you are going to be posting about.</p>
<p>A good Instagram biography will provide the key information about your business. It will also direct people how to contact you in an official capacity. Furthermore, it will establish your unique value proposition, establish your brand, and help initiate value-driven actions such as visiting your site or buying something.</p>
