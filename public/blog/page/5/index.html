					<div class="featured-card__content">Markdown is a markup language developed to be easy for writers to write. It allows writers to generate web pages quickly with excellent readability. It&rsquo;s main purpose is to keep things simple and straightforward so that the writer can focus on the content rather than formatting. Markdown syntax is an alternative to HTML. It is not as powerful, but in some cases, it may be easier for a writer who doesn&rsquo;t know HTML (or doesn&rsquo;t want to know HTML) than learning that language.</div>

					<div class="featured-card__content">When starting a business, it can be tempting to go with the &ldquo;latest and greatest&rdquo; web development technology. In fact, this same temptation often happens within a business even after it has launched a website. A website that has been built with a static site generator is always going to have a lower risk of being hacked. This doesn&rsquo;t just mean your company will be less likely to be hacked, but you will also not have to throw away any code and start over if things do go wrong.</div>

Often, many aspiring developers turn to shared hosting solutions to program their first static sites. This is convenient because in the beginning most developers struggle with basic tasks like connecting through ftp and uploading their site. As we progress, however, we begin to realize the limitations of shared hosting such as resource sharing and slow responses during peak times.</div>
