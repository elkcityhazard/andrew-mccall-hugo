      <description>Many of the people who come to me are small business owners who want a website built. They always want to know how much it&amp;rsquo;s going to cost then they agonize over which developer they should choose. I try to keep this in mind when I&amp;rsquo;m talking with them but sometimes I still can&amp;rsquo;t help but think how lucky they are to have this problem. I wish I could build a website every day and I&amp;rsquo;m sure many web developers feel the same.</description>
