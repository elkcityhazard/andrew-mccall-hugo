Choosing a Content Delivery Network (CDN) is not a decision to be taken lightly. There are several factors to consider, and different factors apply to different types of website. This article guides you through the process of selecting a CDN and the factors you should consider.

## What Is A Content Delivery Network

A content delivery network (CDN) is a system of servers that delivers web pages, video, and applications to a user based on their location.A content delivery network (CDN) is a large distributed system of servers that deliver web pages, video, and applications to a user based on their geographical location. A content delivery network consists of servers (known as edge servers) that are placed within the network of a provider. The CDN provider originates the content at the origin server and then caches it on the edge servers which are close to the end user, in a location which will reduce the time to display the content to the end user.

## Who Uses A Content Delivery Network

A content delivery network or CDN for short, is a system of distributed servers (network) that delivers Internet content. CDN's are responsible for delivering content to end users with high availability and high performance. CDN's are built to serve content to end users with low latency, high transfer rates, high bandwidth, and high reliability. CDN's are used primarily by companies, web hosting providers, and application service providers. Content delivery networks are used to improve performance, reliability, scalability, and availability of content (video, audio, software, images) on web applications, mobile apps, and websites. The primary goal of a CDN is to serve content, such as a video, image or script files, to end users with low latency, while meeting the challenges of delivering content from multiple points of presence (PoPs) around the world.

## Content Delivery Network and Wordpress

As a designer or developer, the job of [optimizing your website](https://www.andrew-mccall.com/blog/host-a-static-website-for-cheap-on-bunnycdn/ "Host a static website for cheap") and making it load faster is often left to the last minute. This is especially true for people who are new to the whole process of website optimization. However, even the most experienced website optimization enthusiasts can fall into this trap. Navigating the jungle of website optimization techniques can be a tiring and difficult task. It can be a daunting task to find the information you need, and it can be a frustrating experience to sift through the information you’ve tracked down. A content delivery network can be an important aspect of content management and optimization. Using a cdn with your wordpress website can help offload some of the network traffic from your wordpress install to a snapier and more decentralized cdn.

## What Should A Content Delivery Network Deliver

Your website is meant to be the online face of your business. Your website has a role to play in your marketing strategy, and that role could be more important than you think. In fact, it's been said that a good website is more important than a good business plan. If you don't have a good website, your business will suffer. And not having a good website is a huge deal for your business, your customers, and your bottom line. You need a website that not only gives your customers what they want, but it also gives you what you want -- a way to generate leads and sales. For this to happen, you need a website that is fast, responsive, and user-friendly -- both for website visitors and for search engines. And that's why choosing a content delivery network is so important. A CDN is an important tool for content management. They help deliver your assets to your potential customers as quickly as possible. We have 3 seconds to engage our audience. If they haven't been enticed within that period, they are gone, never to be seen again.

## Content Delivery Network Vs Cloud

So what is the difference between a CDN and the cloud? Well, basically, they are both used to deliver files quickly to your end user. But they are used for different things and work differently. A CDN is used to deliver static content (i.e. images, videos, etc.). A CDN is not used for files that change, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. A CDN is used for static files because it is a faster and cheaper way to serve your content. You can find a CDN that is closer to your users, which makes your content load faster. A CDN is a more affordable way to deliver content than using a cloud server. Since you are essentially using someone else's server space, it is cheaper than buying your own server space.

A content delivery network is a network of host computers and cache computers connected to each other by high-speed lines. It uses the Internet to deliver data quickly to the end user. Content delivery networks are used to speed up access to web content, especially for users in areas with slow Internet connections. The main advantage of using a content delivery network is that the network can deliver content to the end user faster than the original source server can. It also reduces the computational load on the original server and reduces the amount of content that is transferred over the Internet. The term ” content delivery network” (CDN) is sometimes used to refer to a cloud computing service specifically designed for content delivery. A cloud computing service is a collection of interconnected servers that provide shared resources, software, and information to computers and other devices on demand.

## What Is An Edge Network

In conventional networking, network nodes communicate with third-party servers over the central backbone, and hence the communication paths are longer than the data paths. By contrast, in edge networking, the nodes communicate with each other directly, meaning the data path is identical to the communication path. In this way, edge networking enables the distribution and partitioning of network processing, and edge servers can be deployed in various locations (e.g. around the city, campus, or enterprise). This means that an edge server can communicate directly with any other edge server that is within the communication range, which helps to reduce the volume of traffic between the servers and the backbone, and therefore reduces the burden of large backbone nodes. In addition, edge networking could greatly improve network efficiency, since it enables data queries and computation near the place where data is generated.

## What Is Edge Computing

Edge computing is a distributed computing framework that brings enterprise applications closer to data sources such as IoT devices or local edge servers. Edge computing advances the capabilities of IoT devices and systems by providing real-time insights, accelerating data processing, enhancing security, and improving system resiliency. Edge computing boosts IoT performance in two ways: 1) it offloads the heavy lifting from centralized data centers to the IoT devices or edge servers, and 2) it places devices closer to the data, which lowers network latency.

### Final Thoughts
A good CDN can speed up your website by delivering your files to users faster. When you compare the costs of different CDNs, you’ll see that the costs can vary significantly. We recommend that you do your research and determine which CDN is the best value for you. When it comes to choosing an online CDN, you should ask yourself the following questions: 1. What type of website do I have? 2. What is my budget? 3. What types of features do I need? 4. What is my time frame?  If you’d like to get your questions answered and learn more about CDNs, you can request a risk free consultation with one of our team members by visiting [our contact page]{https://andrew-mccall.com/#contact "Traverse City Web Development Contact"}.
