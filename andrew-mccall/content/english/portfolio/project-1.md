The web is moving toward distributed systems and JSON APIs, and the industry-standard way of implementing user logins are JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This book tracker project was designed to learn and practice the principles of JSON Web Tokens and securely salting and hashing user login information. It is written with Node JS, MongoDB, Express framework, as well as EJS for server-side template rendering.
This is an introduction to the tracker project. It walks you through the process of creating a user, logging in, and fetching book information.


#### Project Details

The Home Page Will allow you to create a username.  If you don't want to spend time signing up you can use:

- login: toad@google.com
- password: red1234

Once you login you will be at the main UI.  If you have no books you will need to go to 'Edit Books' first to add a book.  

There currently is no ISBN api but if you look one up it will grab the cover art for you. It will accept ISBN-13 or ISBN-10

From the edit books page you will see a list of all books that can be edited.  To see a general collection just simply return to the home page.

A simple and fun book collection application.
