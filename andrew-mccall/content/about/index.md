## Web Development Philosophy

Productive websites are created through careful testing and development of responsive, and accessible user experiences. My skills with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, ExpressJS, MongoDB, and NodeJS are the tools I use to create clean, effective user experiences that drive user engagement.

Technology moves ahead but it is not always the best choice. Utilizing stable and mature frameworks allows us as web developers to create clean, maintainable code.

New frameworks and technologies are fun, too, but having a product that is backward compatible, accessible, and maintainable that provides a clean user experience that is high converting is what I aim to contribute to your business or project.
