## What Is SEO?

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) or search engine optimization is the process of getting more website traffic by getting your website to appear on the first page of search results for certain keywords. A website without search engine optimization might as well not exist because it will not be found by the majority of people. Another way of saying it: Search Engine Optimization is the process of making your content on the internet more easily searchable. SEO is short for “Search Engine Optimization,” and it’s important because you want people to find your site when they search for something. It’s like an advertisement that tells other websites about your website so people can go there to find things. 

SEO is one of the fastest growing and evolving industries today. With advanced technology and complex algorithms, Google is becoming increasingly difficult to rank on. It takes a lot of time and effort to make sure your content is up to par with search engine requirements. 

However, not all Traverse City businesses are at the point where they can afford to hire an SEO company. Fortunately, there are many ways that companies can improve their SEO without hiring anyone. All it takes is a little effort on your part.

One of the most important things you can do is optimize your content for local searches. With more than 50% of searches coming from mobile devices, 95% of which are searches conducted on a phone or tablet, your local seo strategies will need to be optimized to reach and server your local customer base.

## How Can SEO Help Your Local Traverse City MI Business?

### SEO Can Help Increase Your Sales Leads and Business Growth In Traverse City MI

Search engine optimization is one of the best ways to generate leads and ultimately grow your revenue. It allows Traverse City businesses to reach out to a wider audience, and it’s the most cost-effective form of marketing.  Having well optimized local seo strategies will allow Traverse City businesses to rank higher on the search engines. 

### SEO increases brand awareness and builds trust in your business. 

These are two absolutely necessary components of lead generation. You can only convert leads into customers if your readers know who you are and trust that you are an authority on the subject. SEO helps accomplish these things by getting your content in front of people who wouldn’t otherwise see it.

### Search engine optimization (SEO) is a powerful tool for attracting new business. 
It’s also a great way for Traverse City businesses to get their name out there, and generate buzz about new products or services. However, most businesses don’t use SEO the way it was intended.

SEO is a complex strategy that requires patience and experience, but it’s possible to improve your ranking and attract more customers just by following some tried-and-true principles. If you can properly optimize your site, you will see a dramatic increase in traffic and conversions. Search Engine Optimization is an invaluable strategy but it does take time to pay off.

### SEO can aid you in creating high quality content

With the use of SEO, you can create high quality content that is engaging and builds trust with your potential clients. Search engine optimization will help you to create content that is more likely to be shared on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin and more.  Social sharing is an important aspect of local seo strategies.  This will help you attract more local leads.   When people share your content, you are able to increase your exposure to their audience. 

### Who Are The Gate Keepers Of Your Industry?

When you look at the top-ranking sites in any given industry, you’ll find that there are a few sites that appear to have a disproportionate amount of influence on Google’s search results. In fact, these sites may appear so important that they could be considered “gatekeepers.”  A Michigan SEO company can help you use the tools you need to discover these gatekeepers. 

The gatekeepers of an industry are highly influential sites that sit at the top of Google’s search results and thereby control access to a market or audience segment. 

If you’re interested in identifying who controls your industry from a search engine optimization perspective, you must look not only at these gatekeepers, but also at who else is linking to them.

## Long Tail Keywords and How They Can Help Your Search Engine Optimization SEO

It is difficult to rank for the keyword, "Michigan."  This is because it is a single world keyword that is exceptionally Broad.  A long tail keyword is a short phrase usually 3 words or more like, "Grand Traverse Motel."   "Grand Traverse Motel," has a greater specificity and will help Google drill down what the user's intent is for the search query.

This is not the entire story, however.  "Grand Traverse Motel", can have different types of intent.  For example, are we trying to book a stay at the Grand Traverse Motel?  Or is Grand Traverse Motel a historical marker that we are trying to learn more about.  Either way, targeting long tail keywords can help Google distinguish between searcher's intent.  "Grand Traverse Motel Prices" is definitely more transactional, while "Grand Traverse Motel History" is definitely more informational. 

## On Page and Off Page SEO: What Is that All About?

SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is the process of improving the visibility of a web page in search engine results pages (SERPS). SEO has two main elements on-page and off-page optimization. On page optimization refers to optimizing content, code and structure of your website to maximize its relevance to relevant queries. Off page optimization refers to activities that influence off site elements such as link building, social media activity etc., which influence ranking on search engines.

### On Page Search Engine Optimization

On-page SEO is a ranking factor that you can improve right now, without the help of any outside agencies. It’s not the biggest ranking factor, but it is one that you can easily improve by following these simple rules:

- Create high-quality conten
- Optimize your meta description
- Write good title
- Create useful page titles and description
- Optimize your image
- Optimize your internal linking
- Keep your site well-organized

### Off Page Search Engine Optimization

Off-page Search Engine Optimization SEO factors that impact your rankings in search engines include everything apart from on-page. This includes social media shares, links and mentions.

Off-page Search Engine Optimization SEO is the reason you'll see the same, or similar content ranking for different keywords. It’s also why you'll sometimes see a completely irrelevant page ranked for a search term.

There are hundreds of off-page SEO factors at play. Some are easier to influence than others and some are more important than others. For example, gaining a link from a high authority website is more influential than getting a like or share on Facebook
