faq:
- question: Is Responsive Web Design Enough?
  answer: Responsive Web Design used to give you an advantage.  Now it is simply a
    requirement.  Not only do websites have to be responsive, but they also have to
    have a great user experience and be 100% accessible for those who are impaired.  Our
    Designers look at industry best practices and user exeperience theory to make
    sure your web design is as functional and easy to use as possible.
- question: Can A Web Developer Also Be A Web Designer?
  answer: Yes, a web developer can also be a web designer.  Hiring a dedicated web
    designer is always a best practice if you can afford it.  Web design and web development
    are two different niche specialties that do overlap in some cases.  A web developer
    may not be as versed in the theory of design and it's best practices.  Conversely,
    a web designer may not know how to actually code your website to meet the requirements
    of the design.
- question: How Much Do Web Designers Charge?
  answer: To hire a web designer onto your project you should expect to have at least
    $3000 dollars set aside for your web design and web development project.  During
    the web design process, there are often many changes to factor in.  Information
    or design elements may have not been included in the initial wireframe and need
    to be added after the fact. Web Designers usually need at least 40-80 hours to
    complete their job sucessfully.  More depending on the scope of the project.
- question: What Is The Best Place To Hire A Web Designer?
  answer: The cheapest option is always going to be looking towards places like fiverr
    or upwork to hire a cheap graphic designer.  I suggest working locally so that
    you can meet the graphic designer and be able to communicate more effectively.  Local
    graphic designers will usually cost more but are able to meet you in person, review
    the design with you often, and make changes as your ideas and business changes.
- question: How To Hire A Web Designer?
  answer: 'All good web designers will have a portfolio to present you.  If a web
    designer does not have a portfolio, then you will want to find a different web
    designer to interview for your project. <br /><br /> Is the potential designer
    asking questions about your business and your goals or are they exclusively focused
    on the design aspect?  If the designer isn''t interested in your business goals,
    they will most likely do a poor job designing your website.  A Designer needs
    to have a complete understanding of your goals in order to create a design that
    meets them. <br /><br /> There portfolio should have examples that demonstrate
    how they can solve your problem.  If they show you their portfolio and it looks
    like they have never designed a product that solves your problem, they may not
    have the experience necessary to help you achieve your goals. <br /><br /> Can
    the potential designer provide references?  If they are unable to provide references
    they may not be an expert in their industry yet.  If there are no references,
    it is okay to ask the potential designer to create a small demo work for you.  It
    is best to get feedback from other clients or experts in the industry to help
    you answer some of the questions about the potential designer. '
- question: What Are The Disadvantages To Using A Website Template?
  answer: There are a few negatives of using a template for your website. First, the
    templates can be quite generic and not very customizable. This means that your
    website may not look very unique compared to other websites. Second, the templates
    may not be very mobile-friendly, which can be a problem if most of your visitors
    are accessing your website from their phones or tablets. Finally, the templates
    may not be very updated or optimized for search engine optimization (SEO).
- question: Should I buy A Web Template From Theme Forest?
  answer: There are pros and cons to buying a template from Theme Forest. On the one
    hand, you can get a high-quality template for a relatively low price. On the other
    hand, you may not be able to customize the template as much as you want to.
- question: Is It Okay To Use A Low Cost Or Free Website Template For My Business?
  answer: There's no right or wrong answer to this question - it depends on your business
    and what you're looking for in a website template. If you're on a tight budget,
    free templates can be a great option; however, they may not always be customizable
    or as professional-looking as paid templates. If you have the money to invest,
    paying for a high-quality template or professional web design can be worth it
    in the long run, as it will likely be more customizable and look more polished.
