## What Is A Podcast?

Podcasts are like radio shows but you only need a microphone and a computer. You can produce a podcast of any length, and podcasting is much less expensive than producing a radio show. Podcasting is also a great way to share your ideas with the world.


## Why Invest In A Podcast?

Starting a podcast is a great way to build a community and connect with people. If you are looking for a way to monetize your blog, podcasting is the best way to do that. You can charge for your podcast right off the bat. Starting a podcast is like inviting someone over to your house to talk about things they love. It is a great way to engage with your audience that has the added bonus of being more personalized than other mediums such as email marketing. Podcasts have been around since the turn of the century, so they’ve had a lot of time to find out what works and what doesn’t.


## How Do I Start A Podcast?

Starting a podcast is easy as setting up a microphone with your computer. The challenging part is coming up with quality content that can reach your audience. But once you have that down, the rest is easy.


The best way to start a podcast is to take what you already know and talk about it. If you are a teacher, you could talk about the best ways to teach a certain topic or how to be a better teacher. I have always liked to talk about movies, so I started a podcast about movies.


## How Do Podcasts Work?

A podcast is similar to a radio show or a television show. You are the host who talks on your show. You have guests who are on your show. The guests are either experts in their fields or people who have a unique story to share.

Podcasts are audio recordings of interviews or lectures that can be downloaded to a computer or other digital devices. When podcasts are first created, they go through an editing process that includes sound effects and music to create an enjoyable listening experience. Once the podcast is ready, it's uploaded to various websites for people to download.


## How To Find Your Niche With Podcasts


The podcasting industry is booming. With podcasts, you can tell your story in a different, entertaining format. If you are struggling with what niche to go into, here are some examples of how to identify your company's niche through podcasts.

- **Coffee Podcasters** - With coffee podcasters, the company tells a story about the company, the quality of their coffee, and the tips and tricks they use to make their coffee the best it can be.

- **Podcasts for a Netflix and Chill Session** - A podcast for a Netflix and Chill session is about watching TV, eating snacks, and cuddling on the couch. 

-  **Podcasts for the Commuter** - A podcast for the commuter is about being productive, walking, and eating all the things in between. Talk about lifestyle hacks to make you more productive while you are commuting. 

- **Podcasts for those who love to laugh** - A podcast for those who love to laugh is about having a laugh and sharing it with the world. It features up and coming comics. 

- **Podcasts for those who like to cook** - A podcast for those who like to cook is about new exciting recipes, our shared language of food, and how to perfect cooking techniques. 

- **Podcasts with a focus on family or relationships** - Podcasts with a focus on family or relationships is a collection of shows full of laughter, snacks, and cuddles. The focus of these podcasts is to encourage, inspire, and motivate people.


## Format Of A Podcast


 A podcast is an audio show that is broadcast on the internet. The show's host will read out a script of the show's episodes, and then upload the broadcast of it to the hosting site. It is similar to radio, but there is no physical broadcasting. The host will also record their own voice reading off the script. 


## Tools For Producing Podcasts


Podcasts are one of the best ways to share your voice, ideas, and opinions with the world. However, producing podcasts can be difficult because it takes time and there are many technical aspects that need to be considered--from recording sound to uploading your podcast for distribution. Here are some tools for creating podcasts: 


You will need a decent microphone. Some microphones have a usb connection that makes set up a bit easier, but traditional microphones will need an audio interface to capture the audio into the computer. 

Also, if you are planning to have several people recording a podcast in the same room, you will more than likely need a headphone amp and headphones to mix the recording input so everyone can hear and record their part clearly. 

If you want an easy way to record virtual conversations or interviews, try services like Zoom, Skype, or Microsoft Teams which can let you record conversations. 

Finally, you will need to know how to mix, process, and master your podcast. This involves adding in sponsorships, transitions, music, effects, and mastering.

Once you have all of this, you will be able to pick a service to upload and host your podcast show.
