Every person who has a business knows that it is crucial to maintain a strong online presence. However, the question of how one can best maintain this presence, and what will bring success often plagues small-town business owners like myself. After years of brainstorming, I realized that there was really only one answer: content marketing.


## What is content marketing?

Content marketing can be defined as “promoting or creating valuable, unique content that informs and delights your customers in order to earn their trust and attention.” Content marketing is the process in which businesses create content that attracts customers to their business, builds loyalty, and promotes brand awareness through interaction with the customers. Since people are bombarded with information every day, they want to find content that is either entertaining or informative.

Content marketing can be in many different forms. Blogging, Podcasts, Video, Infographics, Email, Checklists, Courses, Social Media Posts, E-Books, and free applications are all examples of content marketing vessels.

## What Is The Goal Of Content Marketing?
 
The goal of content marketing is to build a relationship with your customers. The start of marketing is to be found, but when you reach the end of that process, you want customers to understand that you are the right company to service their needs.

-   **Directing traffic to a landing page:** is the most important day in the life of a marketing campaign. If your landing page is successful, then the marketing campaign is successful. Many marketers have a misconception that a landing page is simply a web page that you send traffic to. In fact, a landing page is a standalone webpage that is created for a specific purpose and designed to convert site visitors into leads or sales. Landing pages use highly persuasive language to encourage visitors to subscribe, buy, or sign up.

-   **Spreading brand awareness:** Brands are not just names on a page. Brands are the company's reputation, values, and the associations people have with it. Brand awareness is all about how much people know about your brand and what they think about it. A company's success hinges on their ability to create and nurture a strong and positive relationship with their customers that will result in customer loyalty and satisfaction.

-  **Building relationships**: Relationships with customers are important for businesses because it will increase their level of customer loyalty. There are many ways to build relationships with your customers, such as hosting contests and competitions, having a blog or website that they can interact with, and making the customer feel like they're more than just a number. Every business needs to have relationships with its customers in order to maintain levels of customer loyalty.

-   **Bringing in revenue:** One of the best ways to increase revenue is by using content marketing. Content marketing is a strategy that utilizes digital media and social channels to create and share content with prospective and current customers, leads, and influencers. It can include blogs, ebooks, images, videos and more. Studies have shown that companies who are successful at using content marketing are able to increase their revenue by an average of 25%.

-   **Generating social shares and backlinks:** Social shares and backlinks are essential to generating a successful online presence. In order to generate more social shares and backlinks, there are many different factors you must consider. First, make sure your content is relevant for those who share your niche. Second, use quality images as they will be more likely to spark the interest of those who browse them. Third, make sure your content is consistent with your company's brand identity.

## Why should you invest in local content marketing?

Local content marketing is a hot topic in the marketing and advertising world and for good reason. With the rise of globalization and emerging technologies, it has never been easier to market your business across state, country or continent. However, as we all know, where you live or operate your business can have an immense impact on who you target as customers and what they might be looking for. Local content marketing provides you with a way to reach those potential customers within your immediate community and geographic radius.

## How does a blog fit into this equation?

There are many ways to get started with content marketing and it can be overwhelming to know where you should start. But if you're looking for a clear and easy place to start, blogging is the way to go. Blogging is a great place for individuals or businesses that need to build their brand, generate leads, and create valuable content for customers. Your blog could be the first impression someone has of you and your company.

A specific example of a website with an active blog is The Huffington Post. In 2015, The Huffington Post reported that they generated 55% more traffic than the previous year.

Blogging is a positive signal to search engines to let them know that your business is active and providing useful content that will satisfy search intent.

## Blog content: What should it consist of?

Every year, businesses will invest a substantial amount of money into their website and blog content to improve their site's SEO. But what is the best way to do this to ensure your audience keeps coming back for more? Below, we're going over what your blog post should consist of in order to be successful.

First off, you should always include at least one photo or video within the post to help capture the reader's attention. A blog should be designed around specific keywords to target your ideal audience.

It is important to remember that the goal of a blog post is to help answer a question. Searcher's are using popular search engines to find answers to questions. Writing off topic content will signal to Google that your content is low quality.

Make sure that your blog articles are well formed. They should have a clear title, description, summary, and well structured outline. Headings should be in a proper order. It should flow in a way that is clear and makes sense.

## Content Marketing Schedule: What is a content marketing schedule?

A content marketing schedule is a plan for all of the content you will create to publish on your blog, website, social media channels, etc. over a specified period of time - typically one or two years.

Content marketing does not happen by chance. It is a strategic marketing initiative in which you plan, execute, and measure the content to establish visibility in the media and search engines.

A content marketing schedule is created to be used as an outline for all content related marketing tasks. Each step of the process is planned out so that it can be executed each week with ease.

It's important to have a content marketing schedule in order to stay consistent with what you are publishing and how often it goes out.

## How Can A Content Marketing Schedule Help You?
