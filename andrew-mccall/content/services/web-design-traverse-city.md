        title: Wireframing
        description: "We listen to your needs and come up with a wireframe that includes all of your ideas."
        benefits:
            - A wireframe starts with all of your ideas put into design.  Much like an Architect would create a sketch of your vision, a wireframe allows us to quickly create a mockup with all of your ideas included.
            -  Wireframes can have parts easily swapped out and is an easy and efficient way to organize the design structure of the website.  
            -  Wireframes help us clarify features of your website.  This is useful for trying out ideas before committing development time.  
            - Wireframing helps us think critically of the user experience and also allows us to start planning a well optimized, mobile-friendly website for your business.
            - Wireframing saves time and money.  It helps sort out minor details before we begin the full web design process for your business.
